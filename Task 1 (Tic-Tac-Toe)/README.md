# Tic Tac Toe - AI Powered Game

Welcome to the **Tic Tac Toe - AI Powered Game** developed using **Python (Pygame)** and **Artificial Intelligence**!

This project is part of the **Coding Samurai Internship Program** and demonstrates a complete feature-rich Tic Tac Toe game with:

* Single and Multiplayer modes
* AI opponent using Minimax algorithm
* Multiple difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard)
* 3 rounds gameplay cycle
* Interactive GUI with sound effects, buttons, and pause/resume functionality


## Features

* ✔ User-friendly interface built with Pygame <br>
* ✔ Play as "X" or "O"<br>
* ✔ Single Player (vs AI) or Multiplayer modes<br>
* ✔ 3-Round match structure<br>
* ✔ Pause, Resume, and Restart game functionality<br>
* ✔ Sound effects for clicks, wins, ties, and AI moves<br>
