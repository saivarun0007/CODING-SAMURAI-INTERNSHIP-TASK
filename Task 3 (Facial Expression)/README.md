# Real-Time Emotion Detection using DeepFace

This project performs real-time emotion detection using your webcam, leveraging the powerful `DeepFace` library. The detected emotion is displayed live on the video stream.

---

## ‚úÖ Features

* Real-time emotion recognition
* Displays dominant emotion on the video frame
* Smooth quitting options:

  * Press `ESC` to exit
  * Press `Q` or `q` to exit
  * Close the window using the window close (X) button

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

### Python Version

* **Python 3.9.x**
  *(Note: DeepFace and TensorFlow versions used here work best with Python 3.9)*

### Required Python Modules

The following Python modules are required:

* opencv-python
* deepface
* tensorflow-cpu==2.10.1 *(recommended for Windows to avoid GPU DLL issues)*

You can install all required packages using:

### `requirements.txt` content:

```bash
opencv-python
deepface
tensorflow-cpu==2.10.1
```

## ‚ö† Important Note (Model Download)

* **On the first run**, DeepFace will automatically download its pre-trained model files into a folder called:

```
C:\Users\<YourUsername>\.deepface\
```

* You can move this entire `.deepface` folder into your project directory to make your project fully portable. 

* Once moved, the code automatically uses the local `.deepface` folder.

* If models are not found locally, DeepFace will download them again automatically.
